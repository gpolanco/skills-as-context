### ⚠️ About this repository

This is a **personal and opinionated collection of AI agent skills**, tailored to my own projects, workflows, and technical preferences.

- Skills may depend on conventions or utilities specific to my stack  
- Not intended as a generic or stable public catalog  
- Breaking changes may occur without notice  

👉 Looking for **reusable, public skills**?  
Check out **`agent-skills-labs`** (generic, installable skills).

## ⚡️ Why Skills?

This repository houses the **coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices** adapted specifically for **my projects**. It serves as persistent memory for my AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Antigravity), ensuring they always work the way I do.

| 🎯 **My Patterns** | ⚡️ **My Workflow** | 🛡️ **My Standards** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No more quirks.** Agents use my exact preferred structure for Next.js and React. | **Zero friction.** I instantiate my standard features with single triggers. | **Consistency.** Every project adheres to my defined folder structures and naming conventions. |

## 🌊 How It Works

```mermaid

    participant U as Developer
    participant A as AI Agent
    participant S as Skills Repo

    U->>A: "Create a new Next.js feature"
    A->>S: Read skills/nextjs/SKILL.md
    S-->>A: Load Patterns (App Router, Server Actions)
    A->>A: Apply Context
    A-->>U: Generates production-ready code
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

Transform your project in **30 seconds**. Run this command at your project root:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpolanco/skills-as-context/main/templates/init-agent.sh | bash
```

**That's it.** You now have a `.agent/skills` (or `skills/`) folder populated with the standard catalog.

### Next Steps

1.  **Ask your AI**: `"Use @skill-integrator to configure this project."`
2.  **Verify**: Check that `AGENTS.md` has been created.
3.  **Code**: Start building with superpowers!

> "Create a form using @forms"
> "Refactor this component using @react-19"
> "Add a database table using @supabase"
