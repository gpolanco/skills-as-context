## 🚀 How to Use Skills

### Auto-Discovery

AI assistants automatically discover skills in your project. Just ensure they're in the right location:

```
skills/                 # Preferred location at project root
.agent/skills/          # Generic fallback
.claude/skills/         # Claude Code
.github/skills/         # GitHub Copilot
.gemini/skills/         # Antigravity/Gemini
```

### Manual Loading

To explicitly load a skill during a session:

```
Read skills/react-19/SKILL.md
```

### Copy to Your Project

```bash
# Copy specific skill
cp -r skills/react-19 /path/to/your/project/skills/

# Copy multiple skills
cp -r skills/{react-19,typescript,structuring-projects} /path/to/your/project/skills/
```

## 📂 Skill Structure

Each skill follows this anatomy:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md                 # Main instruction file (<500 lines)
├── reference/               # Detailed guides (Progressive Disclosure)
│   └── deep-dive.md
└── assets/                  # Templates and examples (optional)
    └── template.tsx
```

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

- **SKILL.md**: Core patterns, ALWAYS/NEVER rules, quick reference.
- **reference/**: Deep technical details (loaded on-demand).
- **assets/**: Templates, schemas, examples.

This keeps AI context small while providing depth when needed.

## 🛠️ Creating New Skills

### Quick Start

1. Use `skill-creator` as your guide:

   ```bash
   cat skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Follow the checklist:
   - [ ] Create `skills/{skill-name}/`.
   - [ ] Add `SKILL.md` with frontmatter.
   - [ ] Keep under 500 lines.
   - [ ] Add ALWAYS/NEVER patterns.
   - [ ] Use Progressive Disclosure.
   - [ ] Test with AI assistant.

3. Follow [V5 Hybrid Model](skill-creator/references/skill-designer-core.md).

---

## 📋 Design Principles

### 1. Concise is Key

Only include what AI doesn't already know. Avoid common knowledge.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

- Core in `SKILL.md` (<500 lines).
- Details in `reference/`.
- Load heavy content on-demand.

### 3. Critical Rules First

```markdown
### ALWAYS

- Use const types
- Validate inputs

### NEVER

- Use any type
- Skip error handling
```

### 4. Show Patterns, Not Tutorials

```typescript
// ✅ Good
const user: User = { name: "John" };

// ❌ Bad
const user: any = { name: "John" };
```

### 5. Structure > Implementation

Focus on "WHERE things go", not "HOW to code them".

## 🎯 V5 Hybrid Model Standard

All skills must follow the V5 standard:

### Quality Gates

- ✅ **Reusability**: Used ≥ 3 times.
- ✅ **Single Responsibility**: One job only.
- ✅ **Trigger**: Explicit in description.
- ✅ **Local References**: No external URLs in `reference/`.
- ✅ **Version Format**: Semantic (X.Y.Z).
- ✅ **Concise**: `SKILL.md` < 500 lines.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field                | Required | Example                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| name                 | ✅       | `react-19`                     |
| description          | ✅       | "React patterns. Trigger: ..." |
| license              | ✅       | `Apache-2.0`                   |
| metadata.author      | ✅       | `gpolanco`                     |
| metadata.version     | ✅       | `"1.0.0"`                      |
| metadata.scope       | ✅       | `[root]`                       |
| metadata.auto_invoke | ✅       | `false` or `"phrase"`          |
| allowed-tools        | ✅       | `Read, Write`                  |
